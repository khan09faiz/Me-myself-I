    "longDescription": "Built a revolutionary decentralized platform for idea generation that combines blockchain technology with federated learning and multiple LLMs (Ollama). The system ensures user privacy through federated learning while maintaining data integrity using SHA-256 blockchain consensus. Implemented FAISS for intelligent idea clustering and semantic search. The platform can process and analyze 127 ideas per second while preserving user ownership and intellectual property rights through immutable blockchain records.",
